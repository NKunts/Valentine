🛠️ Customization

Open index.html in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit) to change:

The Food Promise: Search for sinigang and replace it with pizza, sushi, etc.

The Emojis: Look for the createRainAndBalloons function in the script to change the raining items.

The Images: Replace the src links in the <img> tags with your own Giphy or Tenor URLs.

📱 Mobile Support

Works perfectly on mobile! The "No" button handles touch events specifically so it runs away before you can tap it.
